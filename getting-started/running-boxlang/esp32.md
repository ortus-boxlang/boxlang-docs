# ESP32

## Building for ESP32

MatchBox supports building and flashing BoxLang scripts directly to ESP32 microcontrollers. This is achieved by cross-compiling a specialized MatchBox runner for the Xtensa or RISC-V architectures and deploying your compiled bytecode to a dedicated flash partition.

### Prerequisites

To build for ESP32, you must have the following installed on your development machine:

1.  **Rust ESP32 Toolchain**: Install using `espup`:

    ```bash
    cargo install espup
    espup install
    # Follow instructions to source the export-esp.sh script
    ```
2. **espflash**: For flashing the binary to the device. Version 3.3.0+ is required.
3. **ESP-IDF Prerequisites**: Standard C build tools, Python, and CMake (required for the `esp-idf-sys` crate).

#### WSL Users (USB Access)

If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you must "attach" your USB device to the Linux instance using `usbipd-win`.

From a **Windows Administrator PowerShell**:

```powershell
usbipd list
usbipd attach --busid <BUSID> --auto-attach
```

### Building and Flashing

Use the `--target esp32` flag to trigger an ESP32 build. You should always specify your chip type via `--chip` (e.g., `esp32`, `esp32s3`, `esp32c3`).

#### 1. Initial Setup (Full Flash)

The first time you flash a device, you must perform a "Full Flash." This installs the MatchBox Runner firmware and the custom partition table required for BoxLang.

```bash
matchbox app.bxs --target esp32 --chip esp32s3 --full-flash
```

_Note: `--full-flash` implicitly triggers the flash process._

#### 2. Fast Deployment (Default)

Once the Runner is on the device, you only need to update the BoxLang bytecode. This takes \~1 second and does not require re-flashing the firmware.

```bash
matchbox app.bxs --target esp32 --chip esp32s3 --flash
```

### Watch Mode (Live Coding)

MatchBox features a built-in watch mode that provides a "Hot Reload" experience for physical hardware.

```bash
matchbox app.bxs --target esp32 --chip esp32s3 --watch
```

**What Watch Mode does:**

1. **Initial Flash**: Performs a fast-deploy of your script.
2. **Integrated Monitor**: Automatically opens `espflash monitor` and performs a hardware reset.
3. **Auto-Update**: Watches your directory for `.bxs` changes. Upon save, it kills the monitor, flashes the new bytecode in 1s, and restarts the monitor/reset cycle.

### How it Works

1. **Compilation**: Your `.bxs` script is compiled into `.bxb` bytecode using the **Postcard** serialization format, ensuring 64-bit to 32-bit architecture compatibility.
2. **Partitioning**: MatchBox uses a custom partition table (`partitions.csv`) that reserves a 1MB `storage` partition at offset `0x110000` for bytecode.
3. **Runtime**: The ESP32 Runner starts a dedicated FreeRTOS task with a **48KB stack** to host the MatchBox VM.
4. **Environment Awareness**: The BoxLang `server` scope is automatically populated with hardware information (e.g., `server.os.arch` will return `xtensa` or `riscv`).

### Memory and Performance

* **SRAM**: ESP32 devices have limited memory (usually 520KB). The VM is configured with a large stack to prevent overflows, but you should still be mindful of creating massive arrays.
* **Flash**: The VM and runtime add roughly 800KB - 1.2MB to the firmware size. The bytecode is stored separately in the 1MB `storage` partition.

### Native Hardware Access

Standard BoxLang BIFs (Built-in Functions) like `println` are mapped to the ESP32's serial console. To access hardware pins (GPIO, I2C, WiFi), you can use **Native Fusion** or use a BoxLang module that provides hardware wrappers.
