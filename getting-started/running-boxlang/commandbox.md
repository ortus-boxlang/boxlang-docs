# CommandBox

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/commandbox.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

CommandBox is a standalone, native tool for Windows, Mac, and Linux that provides a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for developer productivity, tool interaction, package management, embedded JEE server, application scaffolding, and sweet ASCII art.&#x20;

It seamlessly integrates to work with any of [Ortus Solutions](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products) \*Box products, but it is also open to extensibility for any BoxLang or CFML project.  We have created a special servlet runtime for CommandBox so you can leverage it to deploy mission-critical and high-traffic web applications.  We go even further with [CommandBox PRO](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox-pro) as part of our [BoxLang subscriptions](https://boxlang.io/plans) to give you tons of features like JDK management, Multi-site support, Multi-SSL support, Operating System service manager, SNI support, CAC Support, and so much more.

### Install the Module <a href="#versioning" id="versioning"></a>

CommandBox neds (for the moment) the `commandbox-boxlang` module to start BoxLang servers.  So let's go ahead and install it:

```bash
install commandbox-boxlang
```

This will add the right file types and handlers to CommandBox for BoxLang.

### Start up a Server

This guide is short and sweet.  The hard part has been done.  Now, you can start a BoxLang server like any other CommandBox server.  So go to the webroot of your choosing and run:

```bash
server start cfengine=boxlang javaVersion=openjdk21_jdk
```

Enjoy your server!

### Server Home

Like any other CommandBox server, the servers will be stored in your setup's CommandBox Home. The `boxlang.json`, class folders, and modules will all be installed here.

### Installing BoxLang Modules

Just like with any server, you can also install modules into the BoxLang server.

```bash
install bx-mysql, bx-derby
```

That's it. CommandBox knows where to put them and manage them.

### Server.json

You can also make your CommandBox BoxLang server portable with a `server.json` file:

```json
{
    "name":"MyBoxLang-Server",

    "app":{
        // The BoxLang Engine
        "cfengine":"boxlang",
        // Portable Home if you want, or ignore it to place it under the
        // CommandBox Home
        "serverHomeDirectory":".boxlang"
    },

    "openBrowser":true,

    "web":{
        "rewrites":{
            "enable":true
        },
    },

    // Any Environment variables
    "env":{
        // "BOXLANG_DEBUG" : true
    },

    // Install these modules on installation
    "scripts" : {
 	"onServerInitialInstall":"install bx-mail,bx-mysql,bx-derby,bx-compat"
   }
}
```

### Environment Variables

The servlet/CommandBox runtime uses the same [env variables](./#environment-variables) as the core OS. You can find them here. &#x20;

{% content-ref url="./" %}
[.](./)
{% endcontent-ref %}
