# ⚡ Introduction

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/logo-gradient-dark.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**BoxLang** is a modern dynamic JVM language that can be deployed on multiple runtimes: operating system (Windows/Mac/\*nix/Embedded), web server, lambda, iOS, android, web assembly, and more. BoxLang combines many features from different programming languages, including Java, CFML, Python, Ruby, Go, and PHP, to provide developers with a modern and expressive syntax.

Please note that we are in **open beta** and still have many things to complete before the stable release. Please be patient with us as we strive to achieve our goals.

BoxLang has been designed to be a highly adaptable and dynamic language to take advantage of all the modern features of the JVM and was designed with several goals in mind:

1. Be a rapid application development (RAD) scripting language and middleware.
2. Unstagnate the dynamic language ecosystem in Java.
3. Be dynamic, modular, lightweight, and fast.
4. Be 100% interoperable with Java.
5. Be modern, functional, and fluent (Think mixing CFML, Node, Kotlin, Java, and Clojure)
6. Be able to support the following runtime environments.
   1. Native OS Binaries (CLI Tooling, compilers, etc.)
   2. Servlet Containers - CommandBox/Tomcat/Jetty/JBoss
   3. Android/iOS Devices
   4. Web assembly
7. Compile down to Java ByteCode
8. Allow backward compatibility with the existing CFML language.
