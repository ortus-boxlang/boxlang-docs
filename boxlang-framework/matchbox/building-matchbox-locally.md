# Building MatchBox Locally

## Building MatchBox from Source

This guide covers how to clone, configure, and build custom versions of MatchBox. MatchBox is designed to be highly modular, allowing you to include or exclude features based on your deployment needs.

### Cloning the Repository

MatchBox uses Git for version control. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/matchbox.git
cd matchbox
```

***

### Prerequisites

To build MatchBox, you need the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/).

#### Standard Build

* **Rust**: 1.85+ (2024 Edition)
* **Target**: `rustup target add wasm32-wasip1` (required for the default runner stub)

#### Web & WASM Build

* **Target**: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
* **Tool**: `cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli`

#### ESP32 Build (Optional)

* **Toolchain**: [Espressif Rust Toolchain](https://github.com/esp-rs/rust-build) (Xtensa)
* **Command**: `espup install`

***

### Crate Overview

The MatchBox workspace is divided into several specialized crates:

| Crate                     | Path                           | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **matchbox**              | `/`                            | The primary entry point. Orchestrates compilation and provides the CLI.    |
| **matchbox-vm**           | `crates/matchbox-vm`           | The core execution engine. Handles bytecode, fibers, and BIFs.             |
| **matchbox-compiler**     | `crates/matchbox-compiler`     | Parses BoxLang source and emits MatchBox bytecode.                         |
| **matchbox-server**       | `crates/matchbox-server`       | A high-performance web server optimized for BoxLang.                       |
| **matchbox-runner**       | `crates/matchbox-runner`       | A minimal "stub" (\~500KB) used to create standalone native/WASM binaries. |
| **matchbox-macros**       | `crates/matchbox-macros`       | Procedural macros for BIF registration and Native Fusion.                  |
| **matchbox-esp32-runner** | `crates/matchbox-esp32-runner` | Specialized runner for ESP32 microcontrollers.                             |

### Build Features

You can customize your build using Cargo feature flags.

#### Core Features

* `jit`: Enables the Cranelift-based Just-In-Time compiler (Desktop only).
* `server`: Includes the built-in web server and BXM transpiler.
* `cross-compile`: Instructs `build.rs` to attempt building runner stubs for all supported platforms (creates a "Fat CLI").

#### Built-in Function (BIF) Features

MatchBox allows you to toggle specific BIF libraries to reduce binary size:

* `bif-io`: File system access (`fileRead`, `directoryList`, etc.).
* `bif-http`: Network requests (`http`).
* `bif-crypto`: Cryptographic functions (`hash`, `encrypt`).
* `bif-zip`: Zip file manipulation.
* `bif-cli`: Terminal colors and interactive CLI utilities.
* `bif-jni`: Java Interoperability (requires a host JVM).
* `bif-datasource`: SQL Database connectivity (PostgreSQL).

***

### Build Examples

#### 1. Slim CLI (Default)

Builds the VM, Compiler, and REPL with default BIFs for your current architecture.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

#### 2. Fat CLI (All targets)

Builds the full developer tool, including runner stubs for Native, WASM, and ESP32.

> **Note**: Requires all cross-compilation toolchains to be installed.

```bash
cargo build --release --features cross-compile
```

#### 3. Lightweight Server

Builds a specialized server binary with minimal BIFs for containerized environments.

```bash
# Disable default features (JIT, JNI, etc.) and only enable what you need
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features server,bif-io,bif-http
```

#### 4. WASM Runtime

To build the WASM engine for browser use:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --features js
wasm-bindgen --target web --out-dir ./pkg target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/matchbox.wasm
```

#### 5. ESP32 Stub (Directly)

To build just the ESP32 runner for a specific chip:

```bash
cd crates/matchbox-esp32-runner
rustup run esp cargo build --release --target xtensa-esp32s3-espidf
```

***

### Understanding `build.rs`

MatchBox uses a sophisticated `build.rs` script in the root directory. When you run `cargo build`, it:

1. Detects your git commit and build date for `--version` output.
2. Navigates into `crates/matchbox-runner`.
3. Compiles the runner for target architectures.
4. Embeds these runner binaries directly into the `matchbox` CLI as bytes.

This is why `matchbox` can produce a standalone binary for WASM or ESP32 without needing to download external assets at runtime—everything is baked into the main executable.

### Optimization Profiles

MatchBox defines a release profile in `Cargo.toml` optimized for binary size:

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"     # Optimize for size
lto = true          # Link Time Optimization
codegen-units = 1   # Maximum optimization
panic = "abort"     # Smallest error handling
strip = true        # Remove symbols
```

If you prefer execution speed over binary size (e.g., for heavy server workloads), you can override this by setting `opt-level = 3` in your local environment.
